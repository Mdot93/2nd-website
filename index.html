<h2 class="center-text"> Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under - Grandmaster Flash</h2>

 I grew up in the Bronx. The Bronx teaches you to survive.<span> It's like, 'Bring it on! - Wesley Snipes.</span>

<span> As a little kid, I watched hip hop get created. So it's an honour for me to represent the Bronx, the motherland of hip hop. - Fat Joe.</span>

<span> I started off as a graffiti artist in the South Bronx. My tag name was 'Loco' because I would go crazy and tag anywhere I wanted, in the weirdest places. - Swizz Beats </span>

 <span>Anybody can be a rapper, but not anybody can be a classical artist.- Nas </span>

 <span> Hip-hop is the streets. Hip-hop is a couple of elements that it comes from back in the days... that feel of music with urgency that speaks to you. It speaks to your livelihood and it's not compromised. It's blunt. It's raw, straight off the street - from the beat to the voice to the words.- Nas </span>
